Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the following preorder traversal:

[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]

And the following inorder traversal:

[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]

You should return the following tree:

    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g

Example with integer value:

preorder - [22, 12, 3, 7, 16, 30, 26, 33]
inorder - [3, 7, 12, 16, 22, 26, 30, 33]
